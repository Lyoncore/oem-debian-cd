Welcome to Ubuntu ${DEBIAN_VERSION} (${CODENAME})!

This is an Ubuntu live ${MEDIA_TYPE},
built on ${BUILD_DATE}.

The default option is 'install'.

To try out this ${MEDIA_TYPE} without installing it, use the 'live' option.
Unless your system has more than 256 megabytes of memory, you will not be
able to install permanently from the 'live' option; use the 'install' option
for that.

If in doubt, just press Enter.
