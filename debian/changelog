debian-cd (2.2.15) unstable; urgency=low

  * Apply patch for mipsel boot support. Closes: #145318
    Thanks to Karsten Merker.
  * Updated README.sbm with more info provided by Santiago
    Marcia Mantinan.
  * Reordered some woody task files. Thanks to Philip Charles.
  * Added cpp in the Depends field. Closes: #145869
  * Fixed error message in Makefile. Closes: #146184
  * Updated tools/add_secured to work with all versions of md5sum
    (including the one that comes with dpkg >= 1.10).
  * Protect the call to add_secured by a stamp file. Closes: #147105
  * Provide a customised isolinux image. We don't need to
    recommend syslinux now.
  * Apply patch from Petter Reinholdtsen to put security updates on the cd.
  * Apply patch from Petter Reinholdtsen to preserve timestamps, making
    build.sh being able to run with -e set, report reserved space and
    the space debootstrap needs.  Also, handle boot-floppy directories
    without docs.
  * Make sure discover, read-edid and mdetect are on the first CD if
    possible.

debian-cd (2.2.14) unstable; urgency=high

  * Updated the script to update tasks/base-woody. Closes: #138651
  * Anne commited stuff for inclusion of a local security.debian.org.
  * Added NOSUGGESTS in a similar way than NORECOMMENDS. Thanks
    to Petter Reinholdtsen <pere@hungry.com>.
  * Added "decompacted language packs" to the bootable CDs.
    Closes: #139179
  * Corrected name of kernel s/linux/linux.bin/ (why the hell
    do they need to change that name now ...). Closes: #139503
    Change has been made for arches where the latest bf are
    available. More may need to come for arches like sparc
    which are catching up with bf.
  * More changes of kernel name in anticipation of the upcoming
    boot floppies for sparc & alpha.
  * Change the order of flavors in the i386 CD set. First is "idepci",
    second "compact", third "bf2.4" and fourth the old default one. At
    least we have the language chooser on the first CD but it's still
    2.2 based. Reworked the MULTIBOOT code to take this into account.
  * Added capability to generate DVD-sized images. Use bc to calculate
    disk sizes in build.sh and build_all.sh, and use the textutils
    version of md5sum to avoid missing large file support in dpkg
    version. Specify the output image sizes in CONF.sh
  * Added ISOLINUX code (export ISOLINUX=yes in CONF.sh); this provides a
    "rescue floppy like" boot screen that allows choosing between kernel
    images, rather than loading the rescue disks directly from the boot
    sector.
  * Removed obsolete local-variables section from changelog.
  * Added default values into CONF.sh for isolinux support.
  * Change again the order of the boot images for i386.
    1: multiboot (isolinux) 2: vanilla 3: compact 4: idepci 5: bf2.4
  * Put TERM=vt102 for vanilla flavor as it seems to fix the borders
    of the boxes in a few cases.
  * Improved the test to see if we want non-free. Instead of -n "$NONFREE"
    it's now "${NONFREE:-0}" != "0" (same for EXTRANONFREE). Maybe
    should we do the same for the other boolean environment variables like
    LOCAL, SECURITY, SECURED ...
  * Changed the test for ISOLINUX and MULTIBOOT to be coherent with the other
    boolean variables.
  * Dropped old el-torito multiboot support. Documented the choice of
    isolinux in README.devel.
  * added ramdisk_size=8192 to palo commandline for hppa
  * Added empty boot-mips & boot mipsel.
  * Updated boot-alpha to conditionalize the inclusion of APB.
  * Reworked boot-ia64 to use hardlinks and so 1_NONUS.raw is built properly.
  * Reworked post-boot-hppa to hardcode path to palo, and to ensure
    1_NONUS.raw is built properly.
  * Added Smart Boot Manager image for people who want to boot ISOLINUX
    image on machine with BIOS which don't support them.

debian-cd (2.2.13) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add jigdo generation support (see README).
  * Automatically add packages listed by local debootstrap. Closes: #131820
  * Adapted to new s390 boot-floppies 3.0.19 directory structure (Stefan
    Gybas <sgybas@debian.org>).
  * Updated boot-i386 for the boot-floppies 3.0.19.
  * Don't include the base-images-* directories on the CD. They
    are meant for people wishing to install by floppy (who download the
    floppy images from the net).
  * Corrected the priority to match the priority given in the override file.
  * CDs with .disk/kernel_installable have the disks-<arch> directories
    and those with .disk/base_installable have all the packages required
    by debootstrap.
  * Updated base-woody with debootstrap 0.1.17. Closes: #138357

    of cpp causing problems while generating tasks files. Closes: #129044
    Thanks again to Petter Reinholdsten.

  * Update the "Components" field of the Release files. Was
    causing a bug in debootstrap.

 -- Raphael Hertzog <hertzog@debian.org>  Sat, 19 May 2001 15:15:29 +0200

debian-cd (2.2.4) unstable; urgency=medium

  * All (i386) CD's now have a different kernel from boot-disks.
  * Updated pi-makelist, now excludes all of the sparc live filesystem.

    since 2.2.3; also mentioned this in the debian-cd/YACS README.
  * Some minor updates/rewordings in CD's top-level README.
  * Typo. tools/add_dirs line #26 changed to if [ -n     --jwest

debian-cd (2.2.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixes several bug caused by changes in the way binary-all packages
    are referred to in the Packages files. Closes: #76178
  * Does now handle sources for a local repository correctly. Closes: #76179
  * Fix a bug in make extras. Closes: #76181
  * Added a commodity local symlink for old-fashioned tools like multi_cd
    which want local packages in dists/local/local. Closes: #76186
  * Many thanks to Vladimir Michl who provided me patches for the 4 bug
    mentionned above.
  * Changed mirror_check to use case insensitive pattern matching for
    detecting headers. Closes: #70838

    Closes: #72067, #68913
  * There's still no good reasons to remove the unstable symlink. 
    Closes: #68477
  * OUT doesn't have to be a relative path. In fact, the default shipped

debian-cd (2.2.1) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Should go to frozen as well...
  * build.sh,build_all.sh: Better guess at size of bin CD 1
  * Added the "needed" task file as tasks/forcd1.
  * Update for m68k, they should at least build now.
  * Include upgrade-{i386,sparc,alpha,m68k} dir when available.
  * Updated README.html.in (new version provided by Anne Bezemer).
  * Added EXTRANONFREE support. It allows to generate an extra non-free CD.
    The first CDs are totally free and the last(s) CD(s) contains 
    only non-free and possibly some files from contrib.
  * Added extra file to help fine tune the CD sizes per archs
  * Edited boot-alpha to work (I hope) based on what was available in the
    README.txt in boot-floppies
  * Modified build_all.sh so that it puts each arch under a subdir and
    modified imagesums/pi-makelist to support the subdirs
  * Added FORCENONUSONCD1 support - move all non-US packages/sources to
    CD#1 of the set. We then make 2 copies of this, one with non-US and
    one without. Useful for people wanting to create non-US and US-safe
    CDs without having to spend so much disk space.
  * Added patch from Joey Hess for LOCALDEBS support. Closes: #66447
  * Added patch from Michael Schlueter (corrected cpp call when
    FORCENONUSONCD1 was not used)

debian-cd (2.1.92) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * This version goes to frozen since it's used for building potato CD.
    Another one will follow once we have the final boot-floppies.
    But I already upload this one because I'm getting complaints since
    the old package doesn't work with the actual boot-floppies available
    on the mirror...
  * Added files for woody (yes, people already burn woody CD images)
  * Make the second CD bootable on i386 with the "compact" image.
  * Changes to installtools.sh, change to check for documentation
    directory name by $ARCH.
    -> This change will have to be removed when all arch will have synced
    boot floppies.
  * Changes to tools/potato/boot-i386 for support of the 2.2.3 bootdisks.
    Closes: #53529 #58304
  * In Makefile, if there are multiple versions of the
    bootdisks in the source tree, the section "boot:" seems to get
    confused. Not fixed. Temporary solution, move old i386 boot
    disks out of the source archive.
  * Added a file tasks/popularity-contest listing packages by order of
    usefulness (results given by the popularity contest of course). This
    file is included at the end of the Debian_potato task in order to
    include the packages that are widely used on the first CD if possible.
  * Added a bunch of set -e.
  * Added pi-makelist target to generate the *.list files used by the
    Pseudo Image Kit. Needs isoinfo in the cdwrite package.
  * Updated README and README.devel. Explained that the main source
    is on CVS and that patch should apply on the CVS tree not on the
    source package available on the Debian FTP.
  * Added possibility to include local packages on the CD set. Documented
    it. Closes: #50640
  * Documented the fact that TMP path must be on the same partition than
    the mirror. Closes: #59524

debian-cd (2.1.91) unstable; urgency=low

  * Splitted the boot scripts for slink & potato. Updated the Makefile
    to handle this.
  * Updated the tasks/Debian_potato to use the new task-* packages.
  * New boot-i386 which does use resc2880.bin (the tecra image has
    been removed since it does no more exist in the latest boot-floppies).
  * Can now build CD with bootdisks taken from somewhere else than
    the mirror (allow you to use your own boot floppies, notably those
    built with translated documentation).
  * The documentation from the boot-floppies are now installed
    in /install and /doc by the scripts tools/$CODENAME/installtools.sh
    It was needed since the documentation of the boot-floppies does
    differ from one dist to another ...
  * Removed some cruft which is no more needed (master for potato,
    status.i386).
  * Updated README to explain that the mkhybrid package in Debian
    does support the -F option. Closes: #50141

debian-cd (2.1.90-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Moved to contrib because of the unzip and lha dependencies.
  * Corrected the boot-m68k script (bvme600 -> bvme6000).
  * YACS 0.5 :
  * ----------
  * tools/add_dirs: don't create section subdirectories for non-US.
  * tools/*: full slink compliance. Should build slink disk even with
    non-US. Thanks to the help of Filip Van Raemdonck <mechanix@dma.be>.
  * Makefile: added an upgrade target called when building
    official_images. It will call tools/$CODENAME/upgrade.sh if possible.
    Created this upgrade.sh file for slink.
  * YACS can/should generate complete slink images with this release.
    Please test. In particular for non-i386 CD images. I want to check
    if the scripts to make CD bootables are (still) working.
  * tools/apt-selection: removed some bashisms.
  * Many data has been splitted by codename. This is to allow
    us to build slink and potato CD without much troubles.
  * Updated the master file for potato. Added the old one for slink.
  * Status file is now automatically generated when a provided one
    is not available (data/$CODENAME/status.$ARCH).
  * build.sh build_all.sh: convenience scripts to build CD images.
  * YACS 0.4 :
  * ----------
  * New status file for potato i386.
  * When including packages listed in the status file check that they
    exist before.
  * Call dpkg-scansources for generating Sources.gz file on the source 
    CD. And depends on dpkg-dev (>= 1.4.1.6) to be sure that we have it.
  * Add dependency to libdigest-md5-perl.
  * list2cds: try to select all suggested/recommended packages not only from
    packages explicitely selectionned but also from packages listed
    in dependencies.
  * list2cds: many little checks added, now generates a log.list2cds
    file (in the temp dir).
  * YACS 0.3 :
  * ----------
  * This version has herited nothing from the previous debian-cd 
    package only the changelog has been added.
  * It can now build sources CD.
  * This package does now replace slink_cd and the old debian-cd.
    I'll close the bugs (after checking that the new debian-cd behaves
    correctly with the bug report situation) affected to those packages.
  * The Packages.cd files are generated correctly (the same way than
    slink_cd did).
  * Added the good dependencies. Closes: #25710, #36109, #27758
  * Some bugs are no more applicable. Closes: #24708, #25195, #31044, #24418
    Closes: #36115, #36228
  * No source URL in copyright file since this is a Debian native 
    package. Closes: #36111
  * Full GPL isn't included. Closes: #36113
  * Missing newlines added. Closes: #36114
  * The README is a good documentation for building CD. Closes: #17540
  * Added the support for hooks. Closes: #36112
  * Added a link index.html -> install.html. Closes: #38402
  * Files are better placed. Closes: #36110
  * Rebuilding the Contents file is of no use. And if you really need
    it, you can do it yourself with the hook system. Closes: #36116
  * Internationalization is a boot-floppies problem. Closes: #25210
  * Tried miniunz but it lacks important feature like -L ... still
    uses unzip. And recommends it.

  * This should really go in hamm, so that the scripts to build the CD's
