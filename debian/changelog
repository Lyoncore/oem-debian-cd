slink-cd (1.13) unstable; urgency=low

  * slink_cd changes:
  *      Link $TDIR/.mkisofsrc to .mkisofs - different versions of 
         mkhybrid/mksiofs need different versions. Thanks to Peter Kundrat
  *      Removed the now unnecessary frozen sym-link
  *      Put sym-links in doc/ for *.txt in /install, not *.doc
  *      Make sure the sparc install tree is in boot1 for CD 1
  *      When generating md5lists, grep out things under the "dists/stable" 
         sym-link - we only need one copy of the md5 sum for each file...
  *      Fiddle with isomarkboot line for Alpha - it won't follow sym-links
  * others:
  *      Added pkg-order to requirements in README
  *      Added details about isomarkboot in README
  *      Removed "rm -fr boot1" from boot-m68k that caused VME m68k 
         CDs not tbe made bootable
  *      other small fixes for boot-m68k
  *      minor patch for boot-sparc from Eric Delaunay: mount the loopback 
         image readonly
  *      Santiago Vila: mklist now makes sure all Section: base packages are
         on CD 1, and I've added all the hamm base packages that still exist
         in slink into useful so they will also go into CD 1. Avoid disc 
         swapping...

slink-cd (1.12) unstable; urgency=low

         for non-US removal...

  *      fixed pkg-order usage - make sure it doesn't check installed 
         packages first
  *      added --netatalk option to MKISOFS_OPTS for m68k/powerpc (macs)
  *      fixed broken sparc changes from boot-ARCH split

        contains useful stuff!
  *     moved amiga .info files around a little in boot-m68k
  *     added mac fork stuff in boot-m68k
  *     added macinstall-cd.tar.gz for mac forks

slink-cd (1.10) unstable; urgency=low

  * slink_cd changes:
  *		Very slight changes to date handling - previously we could have made 
		broken discs across midnight!
  *		slink1.useful is now generated from "useful" using slice - better for 
		multi-arch setup.
  *     Tiny cosmetic changes.
  *		Make sure the source discs are _identical_ for all the arches - no 
		arch-specific mentions/options anywhere now.
  *     Fix the Release files to say "stable" rather than "frozen".
  *     Check for zero-length files when md5dumming.
  *     Call custom version of pkg-order, we don't need to see conflicts list.
  *     Changed output image file names to include $ARCH for binary CDs.
  * others:
  *     Fixed cut'n'paste errors in boot-alpha, now appears to work.
  *     Added missing " to boot-m68k, now works.
  *		Removed m68k.old - no longer necessary.
  *		Added custom version of pkg-order, with option not to check/display 
		conflicts. Patch sent upstream.
  *     Removed slink1.useful, replaced with slice input file "useful".
  *     Removed ARCH from slink[34].volid - no ARCH on source disks.
  *		Cosmetic changes to vecho.

slink-cd (1.09) unstable; urgency=low

  * slink_cd changes:
  *		We can now cope with alpha disks!
  *     Moved the $mountpoint stuff to boot-sparc where it belongs.
  *     Redirect all pkg-order output to a file.
  *     Added extra "force_deps" option to continue even if pkg-order fails. 
		Use with care!
  *     Added pointer to slink_cd location to README.1ST.
  *     Changed use of TMPDIR to TDIR - apparently caused problems with 
        dpkg-deb on sparc. libc problem?
  * others:
  *		Added boot-alpha script.
  *		Rewrote boot-m68k script in bash, the python one wouldn't work 
		with the mirror layout.
  *     Fixed boot-sparc, $mountpoint broke with split.
  *     Add more files to the .deb.
  *     Changed use of TMPDIR to TDIR for other files.

slink-cd (1.08) unstable; urgency=low

  * slink_cd changes:
  *     Only put Packages files on binary CDs now, so we should get common 
        source disks.
  *     For i386, only use Joliet on binary CDs. Same reason.
  *     Munge packages files - each binary CD only know about itself and 
        earlier CDs - now single_disk is no longer necessary, as normal disc 1
        will do the same job. Users now need to be told to use the last disk
        first on dselect "update" run.
  *     Moved partition checking a bit later - allow the script to create 
        TMPDIR if necessary before complaining it doesn't exist...!
  *     Check that "slice master" works before continuing.
  *     Copy on README.ARCH if it exists.
  *     Fixed thinko in source md5 checking - should now work again instead 
        of just dropping out.
  *     Moved vecho etc. definitions into a separate file, source it 
        where necessary.
  *		Split boot stuff off into separate scripts, one per arch.
  *     Added small extra stuff for m68k - boot vme stuff on CD 1.
  *     Moved volid-reading code to each image step, avoid errors.
  * others:
  *     Created README.multicd explaining order of CDs.
  *     Changed *.info to now say ?/4 instead of ?/5 - only 4 official CDs.
  *     Created vecho - vecho definitions file.
  *     Altered mklist to use vecho.
  *     Created new boot-ARCH scripts for sparc and i386.
  *     Slightly modified Chris Lawrence's m68k install-disks python script 
		to do the same job, now called boot-m68k.
  *     Added ipx to slink1.useful, needed for ncpfs. How did this ever get 
        through?
  *     Updated to "master" version 1.26 1999/02/24.

slink-cd (1.07) unstable; urgency=low

  * Almost ready for addition into slink for release.
  * slink_cd changes:
  *     Build slink1.needed from "master" file from boot-floppies.
  *     Now uses pkg-order to check dependencies - check CD 1 doesn't depend 
        on any others, then check ALL Depends: and Recommends: . Fail if CD 1
		fails, if the whole set fails then either
        	a) give a warning about this if we haven't included non-free 
				or non-US (it's reasonable - contrib depends on non-free)
			b) fail if we have.
  * 	Added work-around for broken metro-motif-man package for the pkg-order
		step.
  *		Added upgrade-2.0-i386 and upgrade-older-i386 links at top-level.
  *		Removed upgrade-i386 at top level.
  *		Added latest sparc patch from Steve Dunham <dunham@cse.msu.edu>
  * others:
  *     Added README.1ST.m68k from Chris Lawrence <quango@watervalley.net>.
  *     Removed slink1.needed from package, replaced with master.
  *     Added more upgrade stuff to slink1.list.

slink-cd (1.06) unstable; urgency=low

  * slink_cd changes:
  *     handle non-US links better
  *     Copy Release Notes onto all CDs
  *     Create README.1ST - lists slink_cd version, creation date, disk label
        (from .disk/info) and gives simple instructions on what to do to run 
		the installation system.
  *     Copy the full set of files for the installation manual to /install.
  *     Add sym-links for the installation manual into /doc.
  *     Added hfs.map stuff for Apple people.
  *     Added $MKISOFS_OPTS_DISC<n> support, makes life easier for special 
        mkhybrid requirements for different arches.
  * others:
  *     Changed the default volid for each disk to be
        "Debian-ARCH 2.1 Disc <n>"
  *     Created README.1ST.i386 - template for README.1ST above.
  *     Removed test genlinks option from arch.
  *     Added hfs.map for Apple people
  *     Added mkisofsrc to packaging.

slink-cd (1.05) unstable; urgency=low

  * slink_cd changes:
  *     now uses a BASEDIR variable so you don't have to start in the
            slink_cd directory.
  *     added more obvious pointers for -F flag for farmers.
  *     check for "$NU", not "$NONUS" when looking for non-US files
  *     cope with non-absolute paths; create things if necessary
  *     check we're using the -F mkhybrid option in genlinks
  *     remove the non-US entries from the list files if we're not using them
  *     fixed up the genlinks stuff to cope with a more convoluted tree; 
            seems slower...
  *     we don't need to do the sed thing twice for the volid files...
  * others:
  *     arch no longer runs non-free by default
  *     added mkisofsrc to .deb package
  *     fixed mklinks regexp to be more careful on the binary-all links stage
  *     fixed mklinks regexp to be more careful on the current links stage

  *     user-configurable mkisofsrc
