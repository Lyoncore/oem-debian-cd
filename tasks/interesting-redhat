/* A list of packages on the first (er, only) official Red Hat CD that
   wouldn't have gotten on our first CD without a bit of help.
   People who grab the first Debian CD at a tradeshow and try to mimic
   their RH install will find this useful.
   Last synced with the RH CD in April 2001, possibly obsolete!
