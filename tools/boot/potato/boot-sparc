                  Welcome to Debian GNU/Linux 2.2!

This is the Debian Rescue CD. Keep it once you have installed
your system, as you can boot from it to repair the system on your
hard disk if that ever becomes necessary.

On most systems, you can go ahead and press <ENTER> to begin
installation.  You will probably want to try doing that before you try
anything else.  If you run into trouble, or if you already have
questions, press the <TAB> key to list alternative boot options or
enter the "help" keyword to show a message about SILO boot commands.

WARNING: You should completely back up all of your hard disks before
  proceeding. The installation procedure can completely and
  irreversibly erase them! If you haven't made backups yet, remove
  the rescue CD from the drive and enter the "halt" keyword
  to get back to the monitor.

Debian GNU/Linux comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY, to the extent
permitted by applicable law.

This CD uses Linux 2.2.14

Press <ENTER> to boot!
